This argument was decently strong, but would have been better if there were no direct quotes. It took away from the flow of the argument. 
I think it was strong because it presented information about cases that had to do with the power that women have to make choices. I kind of agree because if you take that power away from women that is like not empowering them to own up to their choices an
The argument is strong because ultimately it is the women's body so they should have full autonomy over their body and choice of whether to keep the baby or not. 
Here I greatly agree with this logic. While reading this I could only think of the past oppressions that women have faced due to the patriarchal socieety we live in. It makes no sense to me to have males creating laws and speaking for or on behalf of wome
I think the strength of the argument is fairly strong. It does provide examples and a clear idea of what is being said or rather the opinion they want to share.
the justice department should make certain things legal
This was weaker to me because rather than talking about numbers and facts, it discussed feelings which are harder to measure. 
Interesting facts.
I don't believe that a woman getting to chose whether or not she can have an abortion is much of a matter of equality. Men cannot decide whether their wife, or girlfriend, or whoever else, has a right to an abortion. This issue isn't about equality of wom
It talks about rights of women in general but not the consequences of abortion
The argument had evidence to support its claims
The last quote about autonomy made sense with women feeling empowered.
I don't like the focus about "the independence" of a women, the bigger issue is the life of the fetus
The opinions of the Supreme Court
denying the right to abortion is subjecting her to a life without the freedom to choose. Essentially this takes away her freedom of choice. 
I think the last argument concerning a woman and her empowerment to her body is a pretty strong statement. However, this statement may be writes off as too feminist or a counter argument that it is also a man's baby even though he is not carrying it could
I was thinking about the cases discussed but also the basic human right of deciding what to do with your life. By making abortion illegal, people would essentially take that right away from women, because now the choice is no longer hers. Her free will ha
women's opinion hold little value
Was a stronger argument because it had more facts and data to call upon. Had more backing which made it seem more concrete. 
The argument was somewhat not so strong because its more of an opinion that sounds like an argument. I don't know how I feel about it because even though I agree that some should have a choice I feel like a certain point the baby is an actual person even 
The argument is weak because although babies are unborn they are still a viable human due to a heart beat existing. 
This argument is very strong. While rating the strength of this argument I was thinking that it makes no sense to call a child alive right at conception simply because the potential of a child is there. Using the definition of person also helped. 
The argument is fairly strong. However, I also don't believe it is that true since babies are technically able to feel things when they aren't born yet. An example would be using an electrical impulse to check if the baby will move when they stop moving f
parenthood should be solely based on the choices and decisions of the parents themselves 
It was strong because it displayed clear definitions and beliefs on the issue.
No statistics. 
This argument is very fact based, and relies on data, and even mentions the census. This isn't how one should argue for pro-life. To the people that are pro-choice, they are going to be very emotional about it, and I sincerely doubt that throwing facts ar
It talks about the definition of a human and clears that up. It's very scientific and includes research 
This is a good argument because pro-life activists think of embryos as actual people, when in fact, they have not begun their life.
There's evidence but it contradicts the first sentence when it talked about women with abortions feeling mentally distressed.
Doesn't particularly persuade me that much
Weak argument
It talked about the fourteenth amendment. 
That is a pretty strong statement to state, however there are so many differing opinions about this issue. Although a fetus may not be able to survive outside a woman's body until much late, there are scientific facts that show that the fetus has other hu
I was considering what it means to be a "person." So the philosophical implication of that statement and what qualities something has to have to be a "person." I was also thinking about the various supreme court measures I've heard about the topic. 
supreme court opinion can change. its not unanimous.
Used statistical evidence and history in order to back up main claim which made it a slightly stronger piece. 
This previous argument was strong because it showed how the burden of not being financially able to raise a child could be so women should have the power of choice. 
The argument is a strong one because it brought out data that was collected and showed how legalizing abortion has helped women. 
This is one of the strongest arguments that I read. This is because the safety of these woman's lives is paramount while considering abortion. All i could think of was why would we have over 60,000 women dying because they are unable to safely get abortio
The argument is extremely strong. It provides an opinion along with examples. It even provides statistics that supports the opinion.
abortion is a woman's choice, and should be made legal
I thought this was strong because it gave real numbers and facts about women's self induced abortions. I said it was slightly strong instead of very strong because I don't think this argument is the best way to bring people to support abortion laws.
Lots of facts
This is a pretty sound argument, but my only problem with it was that many pro-life supporters would look at the statistics claiming to reduce unnecessary abortion deaths, but counter it with the fact that fetus death would rise much more, and give an opp
It's a mix of emotional and statistics. It makes it more real
This argument provides a good viewpoint other than the moral aspect, which is frequently used for arguments about abortion.
The evidence from the first and second sources are vague, but they do support the claim in the beginning.
I think this is strong because its saying that if you get rid of abortions, people will seek unsafe methods of getting an abortion, which is even worse for the anti-abortionists.
Real world application
It mentioned and gave specific numbers. 
I think this is a really strong argument, because even it takes into the fact that even if abortions were illegal, people would still have them. Certain drugs are illegal, but so many people partake in their use everyday. If abortion is illegal, women wil
The argument used an appeal to authority regarding the reference to the specific doctor, and dealt with facts, such as the number of women who die from unsanctioned abortions. It provides a practical view of why abortion should be legal. 
not sure about the stance of the argument
Im not sure I understood what the argument was.  Was it in favor of abortion or against it? Because we value mental health then we should value abortion? I don't know if I see that as causation or if the people who are brave enough to go through with an a
The previous argument only examines the mental health of women who wanted abortions.  It does not compare their mental health to women who have crisis pregnancies and choose not to go through with an abortion.  That, to me, would make a stronger argument 
These arguments support what I believe. I believe that women should have a choice in determining their own lives. If a child is unwanted or cannot be cared for, it shouldn't have to suffer because of someone else's actions. Children are only a blessing if
I rated the strenghts of the arguments based on the explanations provided. Even though the first passage was informative, I don't feel it fully explained the argument for abortion, rather than addressing when life starts. 
This argument makes sense... for a woman who's trying to get abortion, it can be mentally exhausting and overwhelming when her wishes are denied, and then has to deal with potentially carrying the pregnancy to term. I would argue that those who do get abo
Sae abortions are better than unsafe  / 
That was kind of low to consider the health of the mom what about the unborn baby
I thought it was a strong argument because it has insight from actual women who had abortions and who hadn't and the sources used were credible.  
evidence provided seemed to contradict claim of the argument
I think that any woman who goes through abortion will suffer emotional lost in one way or another.
Abortion is an issue for which there shouldnt be much debate. Its a woman's choice, period. 
I have heard that post-abortion women feel regret. So some studies say one thing and others say another. Regardless, it wasn't their choice to decide if another human being was worth living or not.
the factual data made a stronger case; it made the argument also more relatable to the population of women
I thought the argument was easy to relate to and tied to emotions.  I could understand what it would be like to be in those situations.
If the child has an extremely debilitating disease or condition that would guarantee its being stillborn or death immediately after birth, it may be cruel to force the mother to carry the child full term.  This is assuming the mother would suffer as a res
These arguments are weaker than the last set but are still very true. They show that if a pregnancy is wanted terminated, whether the state allows it or not, it will happen at the stake of one life or more.
The past three arguments, I felt, were very strong because it addressed the concerns of life with and without abortion. The added statistical values from crediting sources added to the strength. 
These are medically adequate arguments, but more should be discussed regarding the woman -- her health, her right to choose, etc.
Women have right to choose 
I think that abortion should not be done because ultimately it is the women's responsibility in the first place 
I don't think this statement was as strong, although it is a good point it does not really use any credible resources. 
the argument seems to make a valid point 
I honestly don't know how i feel about abortion anymore... 
Abortion should be legal. It is unfair to expect women to carry children against their wish. 
Again, a person is valuable regardless of the disabilities a person possess. How dare someone say that a child with down syndrome not be worthy of life. More importantly, these babies with severe abnormalities can provide opportunities for research to imp
I was thinking that it presented possible outcomes that are far worse than the termination of a pregnancy and thus abortion should be legal. Also, it discusses the outcomes of not having an abortion and how that is detrimental to the child its supposedly 
This argument made the moms sound selfish and misinformed.  Financial stress is powerful and a lot of people can relate to it, but I felt like the percentages didn't really offer information about the actual abortions.  It only put the focus on what happe
Financial situations seem to play a big role in the choice to abort a child.  While I still do not agree with abortion, it seems reasonable to consider.
Some people do not have the privilege or the ability to sustain another life and in order to prevent years of suffering to both parties, it is best to stop things before they happen.
I thought the empirical explanation and the authoritative source added to the strength of the argument. I felt that the factual evidence was the strength of the argument. 
The argument included discussions of women and their reproductive rights, and also included actual data, which is important in a debate.
Know the killer of your family or friend is dead can be closure in the long run  / 
how hard it must be to go through that and make that decision 
This statement also uses very credible sources and the statistics they give are reliable
unsure 
I think it is important for woman to make their own choice - however I feel that abortion is wrong. Every child deserves to live.
If the woman cant afford to upbring a child, why force her?
As a women, I know that sex entails the chance of having a child. This is very self-centered. By killing a growing human, who could be women, you are taking away her right to live.
It again provided factual, credible data that showed the legitimate reasons as to why abortion should be legal - allowing a woman to terminate her pregnancy eliminates the possibility of undue hardship from poverty and lack of resources for a child. 
how many examples were  used 
Referenced facts (numbers and years) and organizations and actual benefits while stressing the goods and positive findinggs of animal testing
I didn't know that we had that much medical advances due to animal testing. Basically I learned something new, which makes it a strong argument. 
I thought the argument was well supported and provided many examples.
Animal testing has improved the lives of many humans and possibly some animals
These make a very strong argument for sacrificing the few for the benefit of many. Activities that killed dozens of animals have also saved thousands of lives and prevent many from suffering from highly debilitating diseases.
animal testing is important
Supports case for animal testing by citing scientific breakthroughs, though presupposes a specieist perspective and that such breakthroughs are ultimately beneficial.
A good argument because it uses examples on how animal testing has been effective for us humans.
The paper provided specific examples of how animal testing benefitted societies but if the author wanted to make the argument stronger, he/she should provided how animal testing goes wrong and that animals get harmed but the gains outweigh the losses.
All of the arguments are very intellectual and scientific, unlike the arguments regarding the previous issues (i.e. abortion is murder because life begins at conception). This makes it easy to agree with them.
The argument is very strong because of all the examples and evidence provided of how animal testing has been very influential to medical discoveries. By presenting the concrete proof of when and how animal testing contributed to the medical world today, t
This argument was able to give facts and statistics without being completely informational. 
It is better to test it out on animals first, humans second.
Where is the main thesis 
It  makes true points. As much as I dont want to test on animals, in order to know the effects of drugs on a whole organism, it is important to be tested on a whole organsim
I was thinking that this argument seemed valid and therefore strong. Saying that computers don't yet have the capacity to simulate a brain was especially strong. 
I agree with the argument.

I would like for there to be citation of the statements given, even if I generally believe the statements to be true. It can be difficult to take some statements at face value.
options
Describes limitations of non-whole-body experimentation but does not address the morality of testing on animals.
This is a good argument because it shows that this is the only way to get results that are safe for humans.
There is a lot of information in this paper. The author provides strong reasons for his or her argument. There is no specific evidence though so the reader would have to assume the author is reliable. 
I simply agree with the argument because it makes intellectual sense.
It is important to point out why animal testing is so essential, especially when there is no alternative that works as well as animal testing. By presenting the valid point that there are no alternatives that work as well as animal testing, I believed thi
Although this argument didn't cite any sources or quote anything, it was still able to provide some opinions/evidence on the argument it presented 
All reasons for animal testing are very relevant, strongest argument for animal testing.
Structure and reliable sources 
I feel it made too many assumptions; didn't back up statements with actual facts or sources; too vague
I wasn't quite sure what stance the argument was supposed to be taking. 
Provides a solid reason for why animals are used in research.
Seems that animal testing has many benefits.
Biological similarity has its limits. Even among humans, the effectiveness of treatments often varies great based on many phenotypical variances. The variances between different genera should be even greater. The previous statement fails to address this c
the genetics make the experiments valid
Does not address the issue of morality of animal testing.
Not the best argument because then people can argue that they are like us so we shouldn't be hurting them 
The author only provided few examples of animals that have close body types to humans and in reality the animals actually tested on might not have such high percentages of similarity in body type. The author was persuasive though so it makes the paper bet
I don't know as much about animal testing as I do about the other topics, but this argument makes sense from a scientific standpoint.
I believe these articles were very strong because they presented valid facts of similarities of animals to human beings and how animal testing involves saving not only humans, but the animals too. By providing evidence to support the articles claims, the 
Again, I looked to see what sources were used in the argument, and what sort of facts were used to support any arguments. 
Another strong reason, because the medications and/or treatments tested on animals first may also have the potential to help those same animals be cured of the diseases, as well as possibly treating other things.
I'm conflicted about animal testing because obviously I do not want innocent animals to be hurt but there are sometimes no other ways to test on humans without being unethical. 
The use of animal testing is more dependent on what is being tested and the humane conditions it lives and is tested in.  
I was thinking about the logical reasoning behind testing. Yes, we should be as safe as possible. 
Human lives are more important than animal lives.
One thing that I was thinking about were the rights of animals and how there are some products that do not need animal testing in order to be able to sell them to human consumers.  If there were more stronger evidence supporting this argument, then it may
obviuously human life is more valuable than animal life. we should use the resources(animal lives) available to refine treatments before they are tested on humans
The argument did not make the issue sound positive or necessary.  It sounded like its immoral to test on humans but okay to test on animals, which does not convey well to the audience.
logical
This describes the benefits to humans and the potential risk to humans, but if it's unethical to test on humans, then why would that make it okay to test on animals? The argument basically said that the testing is so dangerous, that it can't be done on hu
It would be safer to have what's created be tested on other organisms first before using it on humans.
I found it interesting how the argument catered to the emotions regarding human lives without thinking about those of the animals. Instead of arguing about the morality of testing on animals, the article focused on the morality of testing on humans. 
This argument does not provide support of their claim but rather the opinion of an accredited secondary source, which is neither reliable to effective.
Specific --> strong
While it's true medical researchers know how medicine works today because of animal testing and testing it on an animal that has a circulatory system, etc., it also shows to alternatives to testing to the dilemma. 
not a strong enough argument with enough information
Nice!
This is a better use of animal testing but not all animal testing is in use of vaccines and can be actually more harmful for animals.  And sometimes humans manipulate the conditions of the animals by making them unhealthy first before the supposed tested 
The argument was on point, but I feel that the last sentence came out of nowhere. The paragraph talked about how animal testing helps other animals, and then, all of a sudden, some organization endorses it. 
All testing is necessary for the greater good and benefit for future generations.
What I was thinking when rating the strength of the argument included the benefits in relation to the harm that may be caused in experimenting with animals.  Although some experiments may be harmful, they might be necessary in order to save many more live
animal testing should be allowed because it benefits animals also, not only humans
The argument addresses the issue in a positive way with facts. 
good thoughts but maybe overdrawn
If the goal is to protect animals, then this argument works. Animals could still be harmed from the testing, but ultimately there isn't any other option or way to test medicines that are meant for animals, than to actually give them to the animals and uti
I was somewhat surprised that the animals themselves also benefited from animal testings when the focus of the studies were usually on humans.
I found it interesting that the text ended with an appeal to authority by stating that a specific association endorsed animal testing.
The arguments included clear claims and multiple examples of support for those claims. They addressed the many advantages to animal testing and the consequences that would have ensued if that testing had not taken place.
Used names of organizations involved so it was somewhat strong.
it was strong because it showed that also animals themselves benefit from testing and from what kind of diseases. 
it provided a new point of view that i was not certain 
If there are regulations, that make sure that animals are not adversely harmed, I would be okay with using animals. However, if the animals are constantly put in danger, I don't think that is ethical.
I'd approve animal testing as long as conditions are well regulated and enforced. 
All arguments were clear. They each explained what they were trying to explain such as why we need animal research or what were the benefits of animal research. 
I find animal testing useful, however regualtions should be strongly enforced to protect the lives of these animals from abuse.
When rating this argument, I found the evidence to be very clear and although, I agreed with their argument it still made me think about labs that are not regulated and still mistreat animals. 
there are regulations even when testing on animals, so it's not as though scientists can do whatever they want with animal subjects
The argument addresses the issues in a way that has facts. 
good point but might need more elaboration
Knowing that the animals are treated well and kept as safe and healthy as possible while in captivity in the lab makes the process seem less cruel.
Even though animals are being tested, there are still laws that protect them.
I found that the strongest argument was the text containing statistics of the diseases that were cured due to animal testing.
The argument makes an arguments that is for the most part supported by an adequate amount of  support; however is not extensively supported by the evidence.
Specific arguments are very strong. The strongest ones are the one's that are detailed but ALSO have statistics because even if statistics can be inaccurate, they are still very powerful in arguments.
The ones I rated with high strength provided facts and how testing has benefitted the human race. It's not about feelings or emotions when choosing this, it's about what is persuasive. While the article on agencies that regulate animal testing was valid w
strong and informative
the fact that it brought in the  notion for choice, makes this argument more appealing / 
They were a tie.
I think that neither of the arguments were strong enough to convince me about assisted suicide. The first argument didn't help me much because of the odd statement that was made at the end about the doctors knowing that assisted suicide is a bad thing or 
The argument seemed strong in the sense that it rightly mentioned the analogy of the right to speech does not mean people do not have the right to remain silent. Also the purpose of ceasing suffering is a choice made by an individual about their situation
Although I agree with some of the author's statements, the opening sentences where questionable. The right to life does not necessarily mean the right to death.
I thought it was sound to bring up the fact that the right to human like if very much like other rights and in the end that it is all up to the individual as to how they would like to use that right. It seems logical and appeals to everyones own selfishne
I really like how the speaker says that a right is also a right to choose. By defining the word in that way, the speaker opens the reader's eyes to the possibility of the speaker being factually correct. A right to choose is definitely a right.
In these arguments, it shows that it should be the choice of the patient to choose whether or not to live or survive. It is about dignity and self respect. All of these arguments showed that the patient should not be limited to something that will make th
This argument touched on the main points of assisted suicide and I believe also included some relevant associations with other forms of human activity to relate it to. Often times, many people will commit suicide with or without the help of a physician, b
If they choose to kill themselves then I guess so, i personally wouldn't really think that it is right to do so but why live a sh*ty life.
This argument made a lot of assumptions about what multiple rights mean, but it was not necessarily a strong argument because the rights that were outlined implicitly state the opposite. However this argument wasn't completely weak because it consisted of
Health in third world countries 
This argument brought a good point to assisted suicide that I didn't really open my eyes to.
I thought that the argument was too sterile in its appeal.  It felt passive.
The comparisons between different rights seemed to have worked well in this case. I didn't put much thought into whether it is acceptable to compare life/death to other rights though.
There is something gravely wrong in thinking that one's only control in life is to choose death by seeing death as a way out. 
the argument was not that strong because t was able to play with your emotions, but there was no evidence presented
It was based on how i felt while reading the argument.
I do think that the individual has the right to choose if they want to die or not especially if it is a terminal illness that is causing them emotional or psychological pain that they cannot tolerate and want to be freed from.
I rated that argument as strong as it is very right that if a person is in intolerable pain they should have the right to choose to end their life and terminal diseases usually may present this situation. However, the other end of the stick is knowing whe
The argument seemed very logical. By listing the effects of denying assisted suicide, the author points out the downside of refusing the assistance may be worse than actually offering the service.
I was imagining myself in the position where if i was in a vegetative state, what I would like to do. For me personally ive always believed that if my life were to ever come to that point, I would rather have it end because there is no point in living a l
By bringing up the fact that there is terminal pain that cannot be controlled, the speaker makes the reader feel more emotionally strong towards this issue. If there is terminal pain that cannot be alleviated, it makes the reader sympathize with the one r
People in weak mental states should be able to decide, however what makes someone in this state able to act and make a decision?
This argument had strength to me because it appealed to the feelings of the one who was intending on committing suicide. It considered death by choice to be a better option than vegetation for an unspecified amount of time, to live simply to live, instead
In a sense I guess if a person really hates their life and cannot do anything about it, they can I guess kill themselves.
Many of the facts were not soundly based on evidence, but the ideas behind them have been observed time and time again in terminal patients suffering from an illness. Their pain cannot be alleviated completely, and too many drugs leave them in a hardly lu
How to deal with a person with a terminal illness 
Despite the strong argument, my opinion of assisted suicide is firm. I do not think assisted suicide is right and should be banned. 
I already feel strongly about this, and I was thinking that if the quality of life does not exist, and the subject clearly wants to end their life, then it should be an option for them.
I would have liked  to see more evidence/statistical data from studies to back up the claims the author was making. 
Could there be more elaboration on the dignity that comes with choosing death as an escape?
yes it is the family that has to endure the suffering after losing a loved one, but the argument made about the family members not knowing how much pain a patient is going through just doesn't make sense to me. if they are ignorant and careless towards th
It appealed to my emotions.
i feel that both arguments were pretty interesting and convincing. the second to me was most interesting because it aligns with my belief that if we were to legalize assisted suicide, then having a family or support system is crucial to this process. As l
I found the previous argument only slightly strong in the point it made that the families would feel less guilt if they knew why and how assisted suicide measures were being taken then having to suffer unexplained loss of a loved one. However, the inadequ
The point that legalizing suicide would open up discussion seems to be a legitimate point. Opening suicide for discussion may lead to emotional healing.
reading it, I do not get what the point of the argument is. I understand what they are conveying, but it seems rather like a  statement than an argument and does nothing to convince me of anything and instead informs me of possibilities.
This was a good argument because it brought the issue of closure to the person's loved ones. By saying that assisted suicide can help other people get involved in the person's decision and that could either save his life or provide closure, this argument 
The benefits of making it an open and legal process can help people cope with the decision. Instead of those living blaming it on themselves, they may be able to speak with the person who wants to commit suicide and can potentially protect them from makin
I liked the idea that was brought up here about being out in the open with the family. If a patient feels alone, it is more likely that they will want to commit suicide, because they feel like nobody would care. The idea that assisted suicide legalization
No family would want to witness something this horrible. People can be considerate but people do not know exactly what the person is going through. 
This argument is strong because it tells the benefits of assisted suicide, but acknowledges that making it an option can help those considering it come to terms with their illness with their family and may even persuade them to chose to live longer. 
How my family would feel personally
This argument plays with emotions more than it uses logic or fact-based evidence. In a sense, this is also a smart approach in persuading someone
I was thinking how ridiculous it is that this is not already an option for terminally ill people.
At first I was confused because I thought the general direction of the first sentence was going to lead against assisted suicide. 
Should not doctors' prime goal to heal and bring life? If a patient fully consciously wants to die, a doctor then has the responsilbility of addressing that hurt instead of assiting in killing the patient.
Doctors already agree to some extent
The argument appealed to a sense of pathos and was well worded. The description of what a doctor's purpose is also added to the overall argument.
Postion was very clear. Even brought up something that SHOULD happen, more insight into the future. Brought in some facts and was concise, strengthened argument. 
I think that if a patient is in pain, as mentioned before, they should not have to tolerate it anymore. I think if the patient like that expresses the desire to die, multiple doctors should meet with this person, assess the situation, and then make the fi
Thoughts and ideas were more clearly pointed out. The argument related emotional anguish as a reason for the assisted suicide which makes sense.
Strong argument.
It is nice to see that there were some statistics used, but it would have been better if the source of the information was noted. What was best about the argument is its appeal to pathos, noting that assisted suicide can alleviate physical and emotional p
Each individual has a right to life, which means that each individual has a right to die. Although physicians are bound to the law to not assist patients with death, the option should be available
I though the first argument was very strong because it used pathos to address its argument. I felt that the last two arguments were weaker than the first one because I felt that it tried to connect different rights and they made their arguments confusing.
It's interesting that, based on an opinion poll, so many physicians practice this under certain circumstances. I think it would be helpful to add more data but this statistic alone leads me to wonder: if this was addressed on a wider scale, how many other
I believe assisted suicide should be legal due to the fact that some patients really are suffering with whatever illness they may have. I think with it being legal it can be regulated.
Providing this as an option should be implemented.  It is an issue that a patient may be strongly in favor for that should be openly discussed with family members and the doctor.
I believe that these cases should be monitored and regulated for preventing suicides or assisted suicides.  Once given life or birth, I believe its your duty and role to live a fulfilled life at the respect of your parents.  
It was a weak argument because the author did not provide any information on where the statistic was from. 
thats sad
Although the argument does use statistics, it uses it in a faulty manner. The second thing that came to mind after reading the selection was that the murder rate is also a certain percentage and illegal. But that doesn't mean it should be made legal just 
how although there is an impact on the doctor the focus should be about the patient and family
Quotes aren't convincing, but that we already do something similar to assisted suicide is a strong point.
The main argument itself was not focused and by comparing itself to other arguments, it brought down its overall strength. 
I honestly got confused with what this person was trying to point out. If they were more concise and straightforward about where they stood on this position, it would of made for a better argument. 
I think it will be obvious when someone wants to die or wishes to continue living. I don't know how a doctor could accidentally assist in suicide; the patient, or whoever represents the patient's wishes, will make it very clear. I don't think it's easy at
This argument was stong to me beacuse it provided an example where people basically legally commit suicide by refusing treatment. That seems very similar to me and make the legal line fairly gray. 
I was seeing if there were any fallacies within their argument and there weren't any that stuck out to me so I thought their argument was relatively strong.
The argument seemed a bit all over the place. It brought up some good points, but it didn't focus on a single point. Some points were merely stated and not justified. However, I did feel that the points that were brought up were valid.
The argument completely generalizes death and ignores other possibilities why the person wants to die in the first place
The first one I felt was very bias on its argument. I thought it should have a better opening because it can oppose many people who read it. The second argument was a little weak. I felt that is compelled a more intuitive response to assisted suicide; how
I think the author needs more evidence for his last statement when discussing how voluntary euthanasia won't lead to voluntary euthanasia. Although doctors might seem to know the difference between the last two statements, it is important for doctors to b
I believe that doctors do indeed understand the difference between those that are suffering and want to end their suffering rather than those that just want to kill themselves
good argument, however I think assisted suicide is something far different compared to wartime death.
this is a hard topic and complicated one..... euthenasia and suffering I would agree to for assisted suicide or cutting the line but other cases I'm against it. 
I rated my opinion as I did because it appeals to the audience logically and ethically 
nothing / 
The argument piqued my interest by following a clear logical flow that was easy to understand. It cited the opinion of someone who sounded like they could be an expert. 
pointing out that religious people say killing is ok in war made it more convincing that assisted suicide is ok
Strong wording like "must", call to action
The terms used added to the strength of the argument. 
This person seems to see it both ways, so they say that they should be given clear options so as to choose wisely. Shows that the argument implies a little empathy and understanding.  / 
I think people should have the right to not suffer anymore. Death should not always be the answer, though. If a person is in severe physical pain that is incurable, they should not have to suffer any longer. However, if it is emotional pain or a mental il

Very insightful, addressed potential arguments against their claim and explained themselves properly.
I appreciate how the writer noted that assisted suicide is not trying to resolve the cause for a person's issues, but finding a way to deal with the issues. It acknowledges an argument that can be made by opponents, but then demonstrates why it is not a p
Assisted suicide does provide the family of the individual some closure. I believe that the person who chooses to end his or her life has the complete right to do so. If the suicide is medically assisted by a physician, then at least the person is given t
I thought this argument was weak. I felt it wasn't giving a clear message as to what the argument was. I felt that it was more of a solution than describing and discussion an argument. 
The writer includes this idea that doctors should discuss all options with their patients which I feel is really important before deciding on assisted suicide. 
I think it should thoroughly be discussed with the patient and let them know their options before they opt for assisted suicide
I believe its a strong argument, because assisted suicide is not a yes or no question.  It should be something that a patient would like and their family members and not necessarily because its the only option. 
I'm not sure How I'd feel if this was my case and I was in the patient's shoes knowing the situation.  Maybe I'd say I'd need another doctor's opinion before the assisted death..
Even though the argument was presented in a logical way, it didn't have any evidence supporting the claim

The wording and logic of the argument was hard to follow and I easily lost interest in seeing what position the argument held. As well, not entirely sure what "pallative" meant. First time seeing that word in such context. No evidence offered to  back up

I dont agree that the death penalty brings the family of the victim closure. The arguement said it was keep them at ease knowing the murderer wont escape parol or anything life that but if the murderer was granted life in prison, it would be the same thin
The previous argument provided a real life situation that made the argument convincing. 
Taking accounts from families makes the death penalty seem worth keeping.  Also, stating that the trials are very lengthy and that very few innocent people receive the death penalty is also a plus for keeping it.
I can understand why families of victims would want the death penalty. It goes back to the fairness issue behind it. If they can kill someone you love intentionally , why should they live?
A society that values violent retribution and lives in fear and paranoia of criminals in prison is far more terrible than one that can come to terms with heinous crimes and look at the bigger picture. Their argument backfires on them, asking them to think
I feel like it would have been more effective to include statistics on how likely it was for them to escape from prison when placed on the death penalty or something of the sort. I just think that statistics would have been more effective in making that a

I don't think peace of mind is an acceptable reason for why the death penalty should be legal. Prisons are essentially indifferent from the death penalty in terms of the prisoner being removed from society, so the fear of possible escape seems like someth
This argument is based of of emotional testimony. Based on their statements, it is clear they are driven by revenge as opposed to rational thinking.
Opinion based.
Word choice, personal statements from families of homicides
Did not state what happened to families where the killer was sentenced to the death penalty and how they felt afterwards. We only know one side of the story and not both and the argument does not state if there was feeling of relief after the death penalt
Closure for the victims family is a good argument. / 
It answered my question as to why there is a death penalty when life in prison also protects innocent lives from further harm so I decided it was a strong argument. 
The previous argument was credible because it stated it's stance on the subject clearly and provided evidence at the end. Although I oppose the idea of death penalties, this argument led me to realize that there are benefits from allowing death penalties.
Arguments that include paraphrases from studies are a little more convincing because you can see the effect that the death penalty has.
I liked that it brought in facts about other countries that use the death penalty. I feel like if people are scared of the death penalty so much that it decreases crime there is chance that the death penalty is being over used. Facts like this should be r
The piece literally argues that ruling through fear is a good thing. Even then, it does not delve into any discussion about the financial burden of the death penalty or the risk of executing innocent people.
I feel like it would have been helpful to include how the evidence was obtained. Like right now I feel rather curious how 1 execution deters 18 murders like how would something like that be calculated how would someone really know that. I feel like if the
How in the world did that study mentioned determine that 18 murders did not occur that otherwise would have? Also, when committing crimes, many people believe they won't get caught. This argument overlooked this.
how much I agree with the statement of the  impact of death penalty may on the society
I felt it was weak because the rates of violent crime and murder are very high even though the death penalty isn't illegal.  
The statistics seemed convincing. However, from what I've heard as well as my intuitive logic, I doubt murders do cost-benefit analysis when attempting murder. Thus, I don't think the deterrent effect really has much of an impact, if any.
This argument uses outside sources and counterarguments to prove their point.
Good point and good information used.
the studies presented 
States statistical evidence of their point and explains what the beneficials are towards the death penalty while providing evidence and a thorough explanation.
I don't believe that fear of death penalty hinders murderers. 
It was saying if you kill someone intentionally then you yourself must die. It seems fair however as the arguement stated human life is precious. But the person making the arguement didnt say what type of human life. Human life of only the innocent? I thi
The previous argument is more opinionated than factual. I didn't find it convincing personally, maybe because I strongly disagree with the contents of the passage. 
If one counts contraception as the start of human life then calling abortions murder is a valid argument.  
I agree with the given arguments. I thought they were well explained. I liked the second one that discussed the fairness behind the death penalty. Why should someone live who intentionally killed someone?
Arguing eye for an eye justice without looking at the bigger picture or offering any evidence for their position is very unconvincing.
I feel like here the person was just stating their opinion on the argument there was not really any solid evidence or reason to why the death penalty would be good in either way. By just appealing to the idea that the worst possible crime deserves the wor
This is the counterargument to my "death penalty should be illegal" stance that I myself think of when discussing/thinking about the death penalty argument. There is something satisfying in the concept of an eye for an eye.
Innocent people's lives are taken on purpose and so severe actions should be taken to murderers, especially intentional ones.
The death penalty hasn't proven to be an effective deterrent. Besides that, I feel that mitigating circumstances aren't always taken into account as they should be, whether that is due to bias or something else, I don't know.
I think that argument works in an ideal world. However, life is more complicated than murderer = death penalty. There are many case-specific factors involved when trying to determine the proper sentencing for someone. The argument seems rather simple too,
This text provided strong reasoning for the value of life.
Opinion-based.
the death penalty argument is weak because it essentially uses language that is not particularly fit for our civilizaiton
No experimental or evidence supported but would be extremely hard to produce such for this argument. However, they are logical with their approach to reasoning and explain why it makes sense therefore it is somewhat strong.
The justification that we should kill so people will no kill is irrational.
The government has certain rights, and one of them is being the judicial branch - bringing the justice to the people, including bringing justice to murders and the victims' families.
we all have the right to live.
This was more opinionated and less grounded in facts.
it was a little hard to follow the argument at first. the time that i really understood what their stance was was the very last sentence. 
I disagreed with the comparison between a criminal's right to owning property and his or her right to life. A right to life is much more valuable in my opinion than the right to own property.
If a crime is committed where someone takes away a life, which was not theirs to take, they should be penalized with the death penalty. 
Who defines heinous?
It is a weak argument because there is no evidence to support. A right to live is very different from the right to own property, but comparing these two made the argument weaker.
Again, passionate opinion. I don't think its about rights, its about how much power we put in the state's hands (for me at least). 
The argument didn't convince me on the pros side and I did not agree with the statement. 
I personaly would agree with most of these arguments that the death penalty does act as a deterrent, does not devalue life, and etc. However I have to recognize these are just opinions of myself and some others, which make the argument weak. Especially th
It seems weird to list life as a right that can be taken away. I don't know. I guess I'm just biased on this one.
The person makes valid points, especially about affirming the life of the innocent being taken away. 
i agree. the only acception would have to do with the mental stability of the criminal. I believe that a person deserves what they commit when it involves other people.
If human life is precious, why is one life more precious than another?
That last argument was very weak, since it gave no stats, and only kept making the same statements.  Although I may agree with their argument, it didn't really give a strong argument.
I feel convictions can never be 100 percent right.
Succinct and to the point. Made sense to me and I don't know much about the Death Penalty.
i really couldn't pick up on their stance on the issue. it was a little jumbled together and hard to follow. also, their evidence was a little limited. 
This seemed like a valid argument because they said that very few people are wrongfully sentenced and that there is a lengthy time for appeal. But, a weakness seemed like if the death penalty became more prominent, there could be the possibility that less
Having been given a wrong punishment for a crime as a death penalty in my opinion is a very seldom occasion. When giving the death penalty I suppose officials go through a lot of thinking and checking. 
Hmm
It would have been stronger with some kind of statistics, but I did not think it was weak because 
Does that mean it's worth killing those few innocent? I don't think so.
I thought it was a valid point but it didn't have any evidence to support the claim.  / 
The argument is just a claim. There is no way to determine if the argument is true or not. There is no study to back up the argument. Even if there is a study, we would never know if the person truly commited the crime or not unless we were able to go bac
The simple phrase "very few innocent people receive the death penalty" just seems to go against its own argument. Most people would agree that an innocent person being put to death is atrocious, even if it is "very few" of many. 
Wasnt convincing, doesnt bring strong arguments 
I dont know enough about the cost of the dealth penalty so I can't say which one would be better for the greater good. I do believe in an "eye for an eye" though. I believe what is considered fair is for a person who commits a crime to receive a punishmen
Good point in showing that through the lengthy process, generally only criminals are given the death sentence while innocent people are not.
The death penalty overall and the jury are always going to controversial.  The jury will always be volatile, and we can't really count on it one way or another.  We can only just hope that people follow their moral obligations and responsibilities.
Many people cannot control their bias and this will be reflected during court.
The argument cited a study which gave it a little more credibility. 
the argument seemed to be arguing on a different issue regarding the death penalty, more about race than whether the death penalty should be made illegal or not. 
This argument brought up the point that biases can exist and that sometimes people can be sentenced for crimes they didn't commit. Then the argument was rebutted. This helps support the rebuttal because it brings up the counterargument and refutes it, mak
Racial bias isn't as prevalent as it was in the earlier years, but having studied the rates of incarcerations in the united states there is clear evidence the our judicial system, consciously or subconsciously, is influenced by racial bias with conviction
A lot of speculation, not a lot of solid evidence
The argument was only talking about racial aspects and did not seem to consider much of anything else. There are many reasons for why murders and it is a case-by-case scenario.
I agree we need reform-- but that takes forever. If anything, we should abolish the death penalty until we reform and can trust the system more.
I thought that there were examples where race was an issue and this was more of a statement to cover tracks rather than an argument.
Included a study to back up the argument which is better than just opinion. A correlation was used to support the argument. Even though there was a correlation, the argument didn't use it to say it was causastion.
This seemed a little irrelevant to the larger question of the death penalty, but it definitely made sense. It seems like there's less to worry about when race/class/etc is not involved. 
It is easy to make an error and send innocent people to death penalty- good argument 
I believe that biases or prejudice thoughts are inevitable. At the point of being a juror, people have many years of shaping so people are going to feel how they feel. Media does not help either.
Racial prejudice is always taken into account whether it is consciously or subconsciously  
It was tough to rate because I myself don't  know if I believe life begins at conception. I thought it was an okay argument because it referenced the government, however i dont know enough about this subject to see if he should have included counterarguem
It was straight forward and right to the point. Too opinionated and not enough facts though
An appeal to authority and what the law states and nothing else. That isn't compelling evidence.
I based it on how I felt about the subject
Using laws as examples of how ethics should work is backwards. Ethics should dictate laws, so saying something is unethical due to it being illegal isn't convincing.
Abortion is a choice between the mother of the child and her doctor. The fetal assault and murder mentioned in the text refers to the termination of an unborn child without the mother's consent. 
options is important
I automatically read the first part of the story and right away I was able to give my opinion. I don't necessarily think that it is murder because I feel that if some young lady was not ready or safe she should not have a child come to this world if he or
Opinion. Group cited has pro-life bias.
This is just the argument everyone always uses without explaining why the fetus is considered a human being so it is not very effective .
If every human being has the right to life, why do the same people who oppose abortion support the death penalty? Unborn fetuses, at least at the relatively early stage, are not human beings, and the choice of the mother should always be the priority.
The argument is considered weak because it is a circular argument. The argument is stating the same idea through different wording and statements and nothing more. 
I think that this argument is strong but not as strong as the others because the first statement comes off a little too strong. 
The previous argument had varying ideas lumped together rather than a single thesis. It didn't provide much reasoning or explanation. 
Is it better for the baby to die as a fetus, or let it come to full term, and be born only to be killed, abused? Or even being abused while still in the womb. Is there really much of a difference?
It has no statistical data it is rather just stating an opinion. It has no consequences addressed, rather the argument just states statements about what they think is right when that is a matter of opinion.
It was an okay arguement however they didnt address counterarguements that came in my mind. For example, situations the pregnant woman is in, whether or not she can handle it or not and so on. 
I do not think its fair to say life begins at conception. The fetus is not able to live outside the womb so is it really life at conception?
She argues from authority and says that there is good evidence for her position, but she gives us nothing empirical and expects us to take her on her word.
They had back up information instead of stating  only opinions  / 
Originally it seemed convincing since it tries to appeal to scientific experimentation and appeals to authority. However, I think the argument misses the point of defining what being human is. The argument assumes that being human and thus having a right 
The text used a personal opinion of a scientific expert to support their claim rather than actual evidence.
to much to think about 
I understand that a child has the right to live but like i said before. A child should not be brought to this world if the mother is going to be unable to take care of the baby and give it all of the love and affection that the baby needs at all time.
Subjective definition of "life."
This explains why a fetus is considered a human life from conception from a biological stand point which is very effective.
I do not believe that a child should be aborted because they have a genetic abnormality such as Down Syndrome. However, I do not believe that life begins at conception, thus the only life that truly matters is that of the woman, who should absolutely have
This argument is partially a circular argument. Most of the argument is stating the same idea in a variety of sentences, but it does try to improve by adding in evidence, however, it was not strong enough to make the argument a strong one.
I like how there is science involved in the argument to make it more persuasive. 
It had a clear and logical progression of thought. It seemed like it would be further expanded upon. 
Yes it is true that a human being is created at the point of conception, but what is the point of forcing a woman to carry a baby and give birth to it, only for her to either abandon it, kill it, or just give it away.
More statements about what they think is right which doesn't convince me. To make a strong argument you need to be persuasive and show why abortions should or should not be banned and explain the reasons, not just state why it is unmoral.
It was a strong arguement as it provided facts. No counterarguments came up in my head. 
I thought that it was a good argument against abortion and brought up many aspects of the argument. Further evidence i feel would help improve that arguments
Many of the arguments relied more on emotion than good data and studies.
Based it on my opinions 
Using statistics like that was very convincing. However, since I have considered this issue before, their statistics do not match the potential suffering of keeping an unwanted baby. It was a good argument, but it wasn't the whole picture.
This argument assumes that abortion is the sole cause for the depression, anxiety, and suicide that arises after abortion and ignores other possible causes such as what caused the unwanted pregnancy, reason for the abortion, and personal situations. 
abortion is important 
I believe that this is a very touchy subject for many people. This isn't something that everyone goes through. Perhaps the young lady could have gotten raped and now she has this horrible monster's kid being developed in her own body.
Claim backed up with results of peer-reviewed studies.
No one ever really thinks about the effect abortions have on the woman going through with it so seeing how it causes psychological issues is an important factor to consider. 
I highly doubt that the depression following an abortion that was the woman's choice is as powerful as being forced to carry an unwanted child who may remind the woman of the reasons she wanted the abortion in the first place, i.e., rape.
This would be considered a strong argument because the argument is supported by concrete evidence and facts that display why abortion is wrong. 
I agree with all the statements because I have heard them before. I think abortion is taken too lightly and is a scapegoat for people who want to have sex without taking responsibility.
There was a main idea and multiple pieces of supporting evidence. However, I would question the accuracy of the studies, as I believe that there could be other confounding factors in the study (for example, pregnant women may be more anxious overall, rath
Shows that some women regret their decision to have an abortion, or that all women who have an abortion are not heartless.

Invoking an existing law is pretty convincing.
Abortion should only be used in times of emergency, and like the argument stated, aborting a child that may have a developmental disorder is not a good reason to have an abortion.
The argument was not all encompassing of abortion, it just talked about genetic defect abortion rates. The debate is much more compliced
I was trying to figure out what the arguments were. After a while, I realized that it was a link between selected abortion rates on children with Down Syndrome. I don't really have a stand on this specific issue.
The argument does make sense that it may be discriminatory, but it still refutes one's right to abort
Abortion should be the choice of the woman, in exceptional cases women should be given the right to abort her pregnancy. However in cases of irresponsbilty and multiple abortions the woman should practice safe sex to avoid abortion.
if an adult has a disability, does that make him/her less important...no!...the logic of this argument is sound...but i'm still pro choice
It focuses on one mental illness, but there are other diseases and abnormalities that may results in worse cases.
I disagree with the discrimination.  I believe that a life should be born healthy in order to live life to the fullest and be stress free from outside discrimination.  If able to know genetetic abnormalities before becoming and embryonic stage, I believe 
Argument is okay
I agree that we should not endorse eugenics, but that doesn't mean that we should force women to have children and most abortions are not due to Down's syndrome, so it's not the most relevant argument.

If the text stated how common selective abortion is, then the argument would seem much stronger. 
Half of aborters did so previously.
This argument seemed biased in that it claimed that women who have more than one abortion are misusing abortion as a means of contraception. 
This argument is like the last. The argunet may be valid in small amount. Some use abortion as contracetption, but perhaps the repeat abortionists may still have the same circumstance as before. They may live in a high crime area and were raped twice.  
The first study showed actual data, but I feel that to say abortions causes a higher risk of anxiety and suicide rates is skeptical. The studies were correlations; there might have been other factors involving this trend. SES, rape, and age are just some 
This abortion argument is stronger as it brought in data and it showed how the birth rate lowered with abortion as an option for contraception

The arguement is equating abortion with all of contraception.  There are many forms of contraception that occurs before conception of the fetus.  The large increase reflects the variety of contraception availaable.
Sometimes individuals don't learn from their mistakes or under difficult situations.  But abortions should still be valid and available for the choosing of the individual. 
The previous argument uses a lot of loaded language to support their claims. What the findings suggests does not equate to women using abortion as birth control -- there are a lot of reasons why women have abortions, and it isn't necessarily for birth con

The logical reasoning in this argument was very flawed and unsupported. The jump from statistics on birth rates to the claim that women are using abortions as a form of birth control was unsubstantiated and under-thought. 
Although I found myself trying to disagree with the argument, I found the use of statistics to be effective. Since I do believe in the idea that one must deal with one's consequences and that it's wrong to use abortion as a form of birth control. I partia
Saying that women are using it a contraceptive method makes it sound worse 
The abortions as a contraceptive measure has data to back it up and expresses the likelihood of a woman who gets one abortion getting another. 
This is something that comes along with allowing abortion for other negative reasons like rape. Abortion should  not be a form of birth control but theres no reliable way to control for that.
how the facts supported what they were trying to argue
Statistics are a good way of convincing people to rethink their opinion. Although the percentages are low, the writer was able to make it seem like abortion is used as contraception 
Like I said, quotes aren't convincing -- arguments are.
The cited evidence is not unbiased and makes the argument itself biased.
The argument that it gives us a "throw away" mindset is very possible, but i still think there are specific circumstances when it may be for the best. This argument is valid but not a strong argument against abortion as a whole
Again, the two ideas are correlated, and we can't actually test this with an experiment. The argument does make a good point about throwing away lives, but will we really see it that way? It's assuming that we can all act like murders who kill in cold blo

the numbers enhance the seriousness of the inhumanity towards animals
Well for me all the facts and numbers lead me to believe that the argument and reason stated was true. Along with that, I will have to admit that it is this part of animal testing that i am personally not happy or okay with so that could have swayed my ju
The second article was more informative to me and the number statistics as well as the breakdown in species of animals was most important to me.
It was only a mildly strong argument in terms of data from surveys demonstrating prevalence of pain inflicted on animals. However, it seemed merely more strong worded and somewhat ignorant of some currently improved and changing animal testing procedures.
The language the author uses is very provoking and will probably disgust many people. Language aside, the argument focuses on the less relevant argument against animal testing.
Good use of numbers and appeals to people's consciences.
Animal testing is inhumane as we are taking away the lives of animals by force in experiments
It is very sad that animals are subjected to pain during research.  It's definitely not an ideal situation and never has been, I just feel that there haven't been any better alternatives to date.
This argument took an extremely strong argument. I feel like it is convincing as they use very strong words. They also provide statistics and examples.
Although I do not agree with his stance, he justified himself well by saying animals are treated cruelly. This evokes an emotional response from me because I do not like hearing that living things are not treated with respect.
These arguments provided real numbers and relatable ideas. Being tortured is something all humans would never want to endure, which causes more of an emotional effect. the argument also gave examples of why using animals has caused human harm, and has lea
This argument was pretty strong since it invoked a lot of sympathy for the animals. It gives the reader a feeling of pity for the animals and lists horrifying statistics about the way that animals are treated.
It brings up a good point wiht anestheia. The numbers add validity .
This argument was strong because it included empirical/statistical evidence. 
Humans are animal killers
The experiments do not even sound very worthwhile to conduct. I was thinking about what people would think if it were humans that were subjected to the same conditions.
It's sad that animals are hurt.  / 
some poeple may consider it hurts the animals
The section on no anesthesia was moving. Testing should definitely factor in heavily on inflicting the least amount of pain to the animal subjects after the testing is finished.
Seemed like it was just listing fact after fact. Seemed mediocre and that anyone could do that. 
This was somewhat strong because it talked about an alternative and brought information but what would have been more efficient would've been to site the sources.

I felt that some of that information was not reliable. It almost seemed to have no real evidence proving what it was saying was true.
I think that statistics proved in the first statement was more convincing for me. I like to see numbers, figures and material that I can calculate in order to prove that something is extremely important.
I think this is a strong argument as it focuses not on plainly dissing the other side but suggesting why and how other techniques may be better thus providing a very strong case of both lacking of one side and also additional benefits of doing things thei
Although the author makes legitimate points, he or she fails to consider if the options mentioned are sufficiently able to fully replace animal testing. 
It depends on what you're testing. If you're trying to test how human skin will react with a chemical then yes maybe it will work, but there isn't a substitute like that when looking for prolonged or delayed responses that only a living being can provide.
Human cells can be used for more accurate testing so that animal testing can be brought to an end, but it might not be as efficient  
I've never heard of these methods, so they sound promising and I want to believe in them, but what are the cons if they aren't predominantly being used now instead of animals?

Using cells in a petri dish and using simulators does not show the effects on a human body. 
This argument gives ways that animal testing can be avoided entirely, unfortunately a lot of the research community will not look at it too seriously, since in vitro testing is extremely different that in vivo testing. As for the in vivo testing of small 
This person does bring up a valid point with alternatives, but is there ecological validitiy in it?
This argument provides scientific examples and proposes a way to further research without harming animals. 
We do not need to sacrifice animals for our experiments
Once again, this argument only covers the physical aspect of animal testing, ignoring psychological tests I have seen done with interesting results. The test I was thinking of was the one that tested how rats reacted to living in a natural environment ver
If we can use other measures for research it is preferred.

Although artifical or man-made human imitating testing objects resemble very similar to the original human construction there needs to be an account for the complications in the individual. Looking at the body holistically is much more complex than the is
Evidence and claims used did not seem very viable. Did not leave a lasting impression. 
It wasn't very strong because it was more of an opinion on certain information and what they were trying to convey was not backed up with evidence which is what makes an argument strong. 
there are reasons why certain animals are chosen for an experiment. there has to be some similarity to at least try
We have a lot of similarities to other animals such as chimps and even share a great deal of DNA with Rats and animals like that. Even though we are not the same as these, testing on animals such as those help figure out if certain things will impact huma
I think the second statement was more intense as it provided quotes by individuals in the field that understand the matter. I am swayed because of the level of certainty that the authors present when they add a viable source.
It is true that the argument makes a strong point in animals and human beings though may share some similar biological characteristics differ a lot  - even as individual humans differ in gene makeup
The author makes some good points, but they fail to mention how animal testing should be replaced.
Saying animals are different from us like that and trying to give a percentage doesn't really work in this case because humans also share over half our genetic information with daisies but i dont think there is anyone who thinks we're closer to daisies th
It is true that humans are ultimately different from animals and the testing results may not apply completely to humans 
We know that animals are different than human beings; that's why testing is only done to make reasonable inferences that might apply to human beings.  It's better to have a somewhat reliable starting point....would the alternative be testing humans instea
While rating this statement, I can understand the argument and I slightly agree with it. However, there are barely any examples or statistics to support this. Its mainly just a compilation of opinions
This argument is weak because while he does make a valid point that humans are different than animals, he provides nothing that would counter the fact that other living things are sometimes needed for tests. He cites an example of a specific medicine, but
The first argument does not stating why randomization is important in testing. It does not relate to why animals should not be used. The second article talks about how animals do not relate to humans, but rats are used as a base line. primates are similar

It was basically just aquote. All it said was humans aren't animals 
Very weak argument because it completely ignore the fact that scientific research has moved forward in the past decades. Seems to be coming from an emotional/opinionated standpoint,
We are not like the animals we test
I was thinking about the numerous studies done to lab mice. The argument was okay, but lacked more explanation.
We can learn a lot from rats because there are a lot of similarities in our nervous systems.  / 
its not convincing enough
The argument that doses of drugs will have different effects is a strong argument for anti-animal testing. However, simply stating we're not 70 kg rats is not enough to say scientists cannot at least attempt the trial on animals to somewhat predict an out
I felt this one had shock value. like whoa did that really happen? And especially on a subject I don't know very much about, it had pretty shocking statistics.  
their evidence seemed very scattered and it was pretty hard to pick up on their position on the issue. i feel like what helps to make a strong argument is, among many other things, stating your stance clearly so the reader doesn't have to try to figure th
This argument seemed valid because it brought up the point that the information it provides can be very irrelevant at times so there should be no animal testing performed. It didn't argue the cruelty position which is the main point most people hear about
This argument was strong with evidence and statistics with unsafe tested medicines that had an adverse effect on humans. 
the last argument is strong because it shows that not all animal testing provides the results needed and that it could actually be more detrimental than anything since the impact on humans is different. Sheds some light on the different results between an
This example shows us that all organisms and species are different. Specific thing may affect animals and may not affect humans and vice versa, hence animal testing doesn't provide accurate results and are not safe for animals or humans. 
Statistics played a big factor and made the data seem more tangible. 
That's one drug; a lot of drugs that have been produced from animal testing have shown to be effective; and even your basic household drugs, painkillers, etc have been animal tested. So just providing one example won't convince me.
The first argument expressed the idea of different alternative for experimental testing for human products very well. The second argument was strong because it explained the cruelties produced in a lab which can clarify for the reader how animal testing i
when it comes to drugs and letting it open to the public, people really need to be careful and try to test the product very carefully before administering it to the public
Used numbers to back it up and is generally not wrong. Species do differ from another and react to things in different ways. This case serves as a good counterexample that animal testing is the way to go.
It is a strong argument, however it is important to note that an animal is not the same as a human subject.  The use of an animal however can provide us with a lot of information about a product.
There were a lot of statistics to prove the facts. 
It used a common drug of asprin that most if not all people know what it is and have used.  It is easy to see the importance of a drug like that and overlook the path that got us asprin.
again, kind of hard to pick up on what their position is. it's not very clear. 
Their point was good and they had some research to back it up but I didn't see any proof to the claim that human suffering comes from shelving medicine that had negative results in animals. This argument words it in a way that weakens the argument in my o
The strength of the argument was pretty strong because it gave examples and explained some of the differences between humans and animals. It also showed that aspirin, a medicine used often in humans is toxic to some animals.
Similar to the previous argument, displays both sides regarding the products use on animals and humans and how it could possibly benefit the human world due to the good results brought upon my animal testing. 
Testing should be done on similar organisms and species if it is necessary to acquire accurate results.
I never thought about how some drugs that were ineffective in animals were effective in humans.
I think the people who say that humans aren't closely related to animals in any shape or form is ridiculous; it's almost saying that we're not animals, but we technically classified as one. But, I agree that animals shouldn't be cruelly wasted in labs and
I felt that the argument was not portrayed clearly. 
obviously humans are not rats; however I think that research should be done on none domestic animals--such as rats--because what other option do we have in testing things in science. there would be no advancement in science or the health field if we had n
It is a somewhat strong argument because it does use a case to back it up. While the argument doesn't necessarily prove anything, it does show that we cannot tell if a drug is harmful or not to a human unless we use it on a human themselves.
It is a strong argument, issues like that do sometimes happen, however it is something to consider when doing these experiments but a necessary complement.
It seem just conjectured. There didnt seem to be many facts. 
No one likes to hear of animals suffering and being killed.  This argument tugs on the heart strings. 
i felt like this argument didn't have much support for it, but it also wasn't the worst one either. 
I agreed with what they were saying but was also shocked because it makes researchers seem so irresponsible, which I hope is not true. If researchers are that irresponsible then I wouldn't want the product to be tested on any humans either. 
Each argument was strong in showing that animal testing isn't as effective as other methods and it was almost uselessly killing animals for basically no reason.
Points out the flaws in the use of animal testing and thus invalidates the process. This of course, strikes a chord in those who are against animal testing and pushes their argument over the top because its shows the default in the opposing team. 
Just for the reason that animals dont know our tongue and can not speak against what is done to them doesn't make it ethical or legal. If the experiment performed is something that a human would not to do themselves or another human it should not be perfo
It's upsetting to see that scientists are manipulating data and using animals for poor research. The percentages made the statement stronger because it made the data more tangible. 
Ha. Would you rather have humans be experimented on? Anyways, animal testing is flawed because the experimenter screwed up. Animals are unique in that they are similar to us; especially on a genetic and molecular level; 
Both arguments were slightly strong because they both used statistics and portrayed their arguments very well.
I guess I understand this statement; so it was good to see another side of what we can test in order to advance our knowledge
The last argument claims most animal testing cases are wrong yet only uses one example to support the claim that "many" are wrong, which makes it a weak argument. One argument had some numbers to back it up and generally was not wrong. This particular arg
There is a lot of regulation put into place, many researchers have protocols that are submitted and put into place that details the use of animals and what subjected amount of pain will be inflicted and for what purpose.  There is a lot of effort put into
Again, there were a lot of statistics to show facts. 
I can relate strongly to this argument because I have family members who have been diagnosed with depression. I do agree that suicide can be prevented and suffering is only temporary. 
Both of the arguments were solid.  I thought the one where someone might change their mind was interesting  but is not the best argument that could be made.  There could be a protocol put into place to make sure the patient is fully aware of what they wer

The author's statement made a clear point which is why I rated it as strong. I think it could've been strengthened by using some facts.
The argument was missing the point of many cases of assisted suicide. It is a way for people with terminal illnesses to gain closure on their own terms. They already have lost their chances to make any further decisions, so they want to make their last de
I saw that they made an interesting point.
This is a perfect argument because it gives me reason to believe why it shouldn't be legal by stating the pain is temporary and can be fixed.
the arguments are very emotionally based; they appeal to pathos, not logos. 
how the sentences were phrased and what sort of evidence was used 
I've heard this argument before and it is a strong argument. The fact that you are denying a person the right to choose (even at a later date) is a big problem. Because as the argument states, the person could choose later that they in fact did not want t
The previous argument is more opinionated than factual. 
I agreed most with the doctor argument about assisted suicide goes against everything they stand for.  Doctors should not be put under pressure by their patients or the patients' families to kill them to ease the pain.  It is not fair that they have to ca
I feel like this argument was not very supportive. I think they could have went in better to how counseling and such would change the situations. 
It ignores the other side of the argument that life on major pain killers, like morphine,  may not be worth living to some terminally ill patients. It treats life as the most important thing rather than the person's sense of well-being or happiness
No evidence supporting their claim, seems more like an opinion than informational or factual
This argument doesn't really make sense to me because who gets to determine that the lives of those that are forced to be under pallative are actually lives they want to live. What if they do not feel that that life that is deemed acceptable by the care c
This was a strong and convincing statement.
That argument seems blissfully unaware of how painful death can be. Once in terrible pain, too much morphine may just allow the patient to just slip away entirely. At this point, the doctor is forced to choose between allowing a patient to suffer or just 
The last argument seemed more of an opinion than including facts.
There are resources available to help the individual from considering suicide, but he paragraph does not state the reasons they should not.
how our society views the value of life
The part where it said "always wrong" made me believe that the argument was more of an opinion than accurately backed up 
It would have helped to link it with the previous argument but I still do not believe it was strong or accurate. It is not societies duty to make sure someone stays alive as the argument claims. You would have to prove that point for me. That essentially 
The previous argument, in comparison of the last two arguments, showed a lack of strength. I agree with the contents of the passage, but the argument showed little evidence.
I thought that this was a very good argument because health bills can destroy a family and this would pressure someone who was ill to relieve the financial stress off their family.
I feel like the argument was effective in supporting the idea that a lot of the times when put in the situation of assisted suicide there is a lot of uncertainty and I feel like this was important to showing how a human life should not be handled so light
As far as the first part, I did not find it very strong. Just don't demand that the family take part in the decision. It should be entirely up to the patient. In regards to the second half of the argument, that is really scary and I havn't considered that
It plays a bit on the emotions, but not nearly as much so as the past two
This argument is not really that strong. Although it brings up some good points, it doesn't it seems to care too much about how the family of the person who's dying feels and not enough emphasis on the life of the person who actually is dealing with a ter
I feel like this argument displayed the difficulties of assisted suicide but didn't take a clear stance.
This one poses a stronger moral argument. Willingness to die for the financial stability of one's own family is definitely a gray zone that should be considered should this option become available to the general public.
Not enough facts.
I feel this is common towards the elderly who may or may not want their lives to end but the family opposes it. This argument shows that legalizing assisted suicide may cause problems and regrets.
this argument appealed to mostly pathos, but some logos was there with the assertion that family could confuse things
The argument provides facts and then backs it up with why it is that way 
Not so much about the psychological burden part, because its a trauma when anyone you are close to dies, regardless of how it happened; but the second half of the argument talking about someone being pressured into euthanasia could be a real concern. For 
The hypocratic oath isn't something that non-doctors or health professionals are able to know.  The argument was alright, but wasn't strong enough.
Medical professionals should save lives nor take them
The job of a doctor, at is essence, is to help others.  Seeing as many patients who want to be euthanized usually have some psychological disorder, their request of their doctor to assist them in suicide does not seem right and puts the doctor in a diffic
The argument made sense and showed how assisted suicide violates the doctor's Hippocratic Oath.
It's purely opinion
This argument fails to talk about the patient's rights, their right to choose not to suffer. This argument also does not take into account that the law for assisted suicide is curtailed to terminally ill patients, not for those who simply want to end thei
passionate opinion... I'd like to see how many doctors are actually against it.
I was thinking about the doctor's oath, and how I believe that abortion is killing a child and that in turn contradicts the hippocratic oath. 
This argument presented itself to be strong because it included quotes from the Doctors' Oath.  However, it still lacked some more in depth evidence that would allow for a stronger argument.  / 
It brought up an interesting side that the doctors had and why there were against assisted suicide.
Although I have a different stance I do think this is a strong and valid argument.  It shows a different side of the argument and gives a credible source which one cannot argue with (The Hippocratic Oath).
Assisted suicide seems to go against what doctors are meant to do.
The last part of it really seemed moving. Looking at it from a doctor's perspective and how they would have to carry that moral weight is really deep.
There is no counter argument and no reliable resources cited, therefore the argument is only relying on pathos.
Logical specific arguments are very powerful
The words that stuck out to me was the part of the sentence that said that doctors do not want to choose who lives and dies. I feel like that is very powerful. There are too many complications for assisted suicide. 
It was mostly just opinionated statements about defining the hypocratic oath
N/A
the argument was clear and had well points
Legal helping of death is NOT like other rights.  Again, the argument was weak even though I agreed with it.
It is immoral to kill another
This argument suggests at the possible long term societal effects of euthanasia, which seem pretty dangerous.
The argument had a logical fallacy, which I refer to as "slippery slope". The article stated a cause and effect without proof.
Diction is better than the one previous
It is morally and socially wrong to reduce the happiness and content of a patient to simply their existence - living... what about terminally ill patients? They have a right to choose not to suffer... just because a patient may live longer, does not mean 
The moral and social foundation being destroyed is extreme and there is no basis for it. However I do understand the concern for involuntary euthanasia, but I think that could be solved by making a mandatory psych evaluation paired with the legalization, 
I was evaluating the scientific basis and evidence (if any) of each statement. 
The one thing that classified this argument as weak was that the study that was conducted was not entirely specified. If there was a specific place that notified me where the research was conducted, I could have possibly chosen to make it a slightly stron
I could argue against their points.
I think this was the strongest argument out of all because it brought up very good points but it could be stronger by stating (again) credible sources for their information. 
The argument made some very valid points about the possibility of some taking advantage.
This argument seemed to be very valid to me. It presented a way of thinking about the problem that I hadn't put as much thought into.
The so called study in the argument was not cited and again the counter argument was not presented. An argument can not be sound if it is completely biased, which is exactly what these last two have been.
The statistic given was important. It was straight to the point. 
It's true. It is not up to someone else to decide if a human dies or not. There will always be people who take advantage of the system.
It gave more factual data; it also gave more possible negative repurcussions as to why assisted suicide should not be legalized - it didn't focus so much on the negative impact on the doctors so much as involuntary death (an irreversible consequence) that
N/A
the argument was a bit repetitive
Netherlands is an obscure area and having one doctor's opinion is NOT convincing at all.
I don't agree with assassinating an other to commit suicide.
Doctors are supposed to help people.  This argument makes it sound like euthanasia is just an easy, lazy way out of having to take care of patients, which again is a doctor's job.
That argument used facts to support the claim.
Not a lot of argument
Lack of hospice care is unfortunate, and should not be blamed on assisted suicide legalities. Legal physician-assisted suicide is a choice, as well as palliative care is -- this would call for more action toward supporting hospice/palliative care faciliti
It's definitely a concern that the sickly/elderly/ \whoever chooses to die over living to an extreme amount. However it felt more like an ancedotal story than a study. 
Just because a country doesn't have access to hospice care doesn't mean that assisted suicide should be legal.
This argument presented itself to be weak simply because it seemed like it was only one person's opinion with lack of research or evidence to support its argument besides convenience.  
I couldn't quite follow..
This argument was hard for me to understand at first but after i read through it a couple time I was more so able to understand that the authors stance.  But I don't think that this was a strong argument again because of credibility issues. 
It is very understandable why there is so few palliative care available when use of euthanasia is so widespread.
I'm not exactly sure whether this was trying to argue for or against assisted suicide. It sounded like it was arguing against it, and if so I thought it was a strong argument. If it was arguing for, however, it needs some work.
None of these arguments have a credible backing. I could write an essay and say some study stated this and a doctor stated whatever I wanted them to say because for all the audience knows I could be pulling this out of nowhere.
Confused on why the argument was so specific to the Netherlands
It is apparent that countries devalue human life when it begins deteriorating in places that offer assisted suicide. 
It wasn't very factual, it just told of the situation in one place and how it has assisted suicide but not hospice. It didn't explain why having euthanasia is preferable to hospice care, or the other possible benefits to having such a system in place. 
N/A
it is just describing the conditions in one country and the opinion of one person not much evidence or sway 
Structure
I think the argument made a valid point of saying that killing the criminal can sometimes cause acute stress. 
I was thinking that this argument was weak because it talked about the victim's families. That is a concern of course, but not a central issue when arguing against the death penalty. 
Argument wasn't representative.
i support the death penalty, its more wasteful in terms of taxes to place people in jail forever 
The witnesses may feel guilt because they were trying to play god. 
Very informative. I like the quote. 
This argument assumed that the family of the victim was required to watch the execution of the perpetrator. Although the argument was strong in some places, the stress that can be found from watching someone die should be assumed beforehand, and I do beli
There's proof that mental distress occurs within family members. This would cause them to oppose the death penalty, so the argument makes sense.
Would like to see more points of view
It had a strong argument. 
There was little evidence provided to support the claim. A little more evidence if required though to make the argument stronger. 
This argument uses testimonies from the families of victims, and there is likely much evidence that backs up the psychiatrist's claim that the trauma of witnessing an execution can be very detrimental to the mental well being of a person.  
Death penalty in regards to children 
This is a really strong argument, because it looks at the victim's families opinions about death penalty. It shows that actually, a lot of victims families would rather not have their beloved's killer be killed just as long as they rot in jail. This reall
is it vaild and strong / are the premises true 
Although it brought up a good point that the criminal might not find the death penalty to be a severe consequence it does not bring up the issue of the victims families feelings.
This argument was somewhat strong because it included some facts, but the facts were not particularly helpful. 
I thought it was very convincing and in line with my personal thoughts on the issue.
i feel as if the death pentaly just adds more incentive for crazy people to commit crimes
I do not feel so informed about this topic.
The argument was not consistent with supporting evidence.
I actually didn't like this argument, but I thought it was semi-strong. It considered the death penalty to not be a deterrent but it then went on to prove that the statistics weren't valid. But then, it considered the crime rates in legal death penalty pl

It gave an example of a state's view. 
The author gave no specific cases and no details about the statistics. The author made good points but did not support them thoroughly.
Correlation does not indicate causation. This argument bases a lot of its claims on correlations found.

No one wins by killing others
Great. I like the quote.

Although the paper was making good points, the author put too much emotion, which may seem that the author was biased or extremely strong on his or her position so it might sway whether the information provided was even relevant
The previous statement had a good moral argument, however considering that many people have different moral standards, moral arguments are not always effective and can easily be lost to arguments with more logical and fact based foundations.
Still about death penalty in different age groups 
I think this statement is semi strong because it does argue the fact that we are civilized beings and do not partake in the old "eye-for-eye" customs. However, I think that this argument isn't that strong because it makes the death penalty seem like reven
The death penalty is a difficult issue especially for criminals who commit especially heinous crimes. However, using murder to punish murder is contradictory.

I'm conflicted about the moral reasons of the death penalty. 
I don't think it is right for someone to continue living if they took away someone else's basic human rights. Taking away someone else's basic human rights is not okay and the guilty should not be given their basic rights.
Too extreme and one sided of an argument, no qualifiers made argument relatively weak.
There was not a lot of focus in the argument. The author should have focused on a single argument and developed it.
This argument seemed to be based mostly on opinion and would need more data/statistics to support the idea of why this type of killing is wrong. /

To be able to possibly save an innocent life and give that person some of their years back is a very strong argument as to why we should not have the death penalty.

The "gambling with people's life" argument was very convincing
The argument makes definite points, but is not quite as focused. Also, the evidence seems a bit weak.
Although the argument wasn't complete, the writer makes a good point by thinking about those who are wrongfully executed. This punishment could be considered the worst as there is no opportunity to make up for what they lost--life. 
The death penalty allows people who should not be on this planet. To make sure that wrongful execution doesn't happen, they should take more time and use a fine tooth comb to solve it.

You can't retrial a person after you've killed him! Why have the victim's family go through the pain of watching the family member suffer?

Especially in today's day and age, taking into consideration race within the justice system is vital. 
Reading about how the differences in death penalty occurrences among the different social classes, races, and demographics provided me with a strong insight in the bias that the death penalty has. I rated this passage very strong because it encapsulated t

I was thinking about how much money is wasted on the death penalty. I was also thinking about how I don't think I would feel resolved if I had a friend who was a victim and their murderer was killed.
Raised good points about the high risks of the death penalty.
The argument was focused and supported by important pieces of evidence.

While I was rating the arguments I was just thinking about if the results justified the means.  I was thinking about if their arguments made sense and held weight.
this argument will support confirmation bias specially because the supreme court justice was a lady and she was a driven, motivated lady who made a legacy with her life. the argument makes sense for her because it suits her needs.
i believe that the statement is entirely true, that women do have the choice to either end the pregnancy or carry it out full term.
This argument is weak because the the only aspect it focuses on in choice. Although it is valid it gives women control over their own body it also seems to be saying all choice made will be willingly accepted. Not everyone makes flawless, unselfish choice

I thought the argument was strong because there were facts stating that women felt empowered and in that case it supports legalization.

I thought that it made sense that fetuses are not self determining beings because they are incapable of thought and actions
I was thinking about the fact that a child unborn is not considered a person until it took its first breath. I believe that abortion is entirely up to the mother and her ability to take care of that infant, because if they are not able to take care of the
The status of "human being" is subjective and so to use it as an argument, as the previous argument did, does not ground its stance in anything factual. Just because a supreme court case determined the status of "human being" to be born, does not hold any
I was thinking that although I'd never heard those arguments before, they made complete sense to me, and that's probably why I feel the way I do about abortion.  
None of the arguments swayed my stance on the issue.
The article only stated opinions. I do not need to agree with what they said, nor have they provided any proof that would tell me why they are right. Just because there is a legislative ruling on what a person is does not mean that I should agree with suc
The argument was based on social practices, such as when a person's age can begin to be counted. It didn't include any scientific data, and used vague terms such as "personhood." 
I looked for factual evidence and checked if the person backed it up with opinions that connected with the argument 
Life should be factored in during contraception, knowing full well of the results after sex. The unborn is a life in his or her own right and the statement that abortion is almost like insurance can be seen as tearfully true.
Argument was even stronger than before.  It gave a very convincing argument and great statistics to back it up.
I was considering every woman's right to an abortion. Every woman has the power to make decisions about her body since it is her own body and she is the one carrying the child. 
Women should be provided with good healthcare to make this kind of decision if they must; they should not be afraid of the possibility of dying just because they want to make a responsible (depends on the situation) decision. And, yes, having an abortion 
Both arguments used statistics so it was more tangible. The first argument was strong because I know of many people in those situations. The second argument was strong because no one would want a woman to try to hurt themselves in order to cause an aborti
Felt more factual. Also I agree with it... so my bias helps :)
The writer argues that access to efficient and safe abortion methods leads to better health of the mother than if these options were not available. This was supported well with data not just in the US but also worldwide through the WHO. 
I thought about the scientific evidence and the supporting comments of each argument.

The argument was good but not as strong as the other ones / 
That mental states are dependent of more than just abortion.
Instead of mentioning all the usual common aspects of abortion people bring up, this person talked about feelings toward abortion, before and after which is insightful. 
I was still fixated on the first argument.  I was thinking that women also follow a postpartum depression so arguing that women who abort have a higher risk of becoming depressed and/or suicidal is a weak argument. Also abortion is still generally frowned

The author had a single argument focused on and provided evidence to support it, all from reliable sources.
It demonstrated to link to issues but still clarify the main issue which was abortion. It was insightful to read.
The argument is weak since it is just a peer-review and doesn't accurately represent the population. I do however would agree with the findings despite knowing it is a weak argument just from personal opinion.
What I was thinking included my own arguments against this topic and the research that they have conducted. I believed it was not as strong enough because I could provide evidence that would counter the effects of their argument.
I was thinking about how the argument was really confusing since the majority of it was spent talking about the link between mental health and abortion but it was completely refuted in the last sentence.
If you don't want to have an abortion then don't get one. Your opinions shouldn't determine how other people make their decisions 
Very true facts, and it appeals to women of all classes and social standings. 
Provided decent support from credible sources.

Strong because it provides examples of the good things animal testing has done
The laundry list of the many diseases that have been researched and cured because of animal testing make the argument weak because there is no analysis, just facts. The argument doesn't explore the significance.
It was a strong argument as it did make a point about the need for testing. It was tough to rate because it is a subject that has positive and negative conesequences. The argument included good facts and points. Hard to come up with a counterargument for

Although the claims are not supported by researched evidence, the support for the claim is logical and the reasons for alternatives not working are clearly stated.
They talked about cells. 
The author makes good points about basic biology of life and how systems work holistically rather than in compartments. 
I may be bias because of my Biology major, but I feel that experimental animal models are useful in learning about the human body and human diseases and conditions.  If we do not test on animals, what are we supposed to test?
There was no proof that animals are susceptible to the same diseases and health conditions as humans.
The more empirical statistics and explanation of the arguments made me rate them stronger. I was thinking about the cause and effects and using those to rate the strength of the argument, as well. 
Animal lives 
In the last argument, I was thinking about how much I learned from school about how mammals descended from a common ancestor. The argument in the last page made a lot of sense. 
The problem I had with the following argument was that it referred to all animals as being similar to humans, but then produced statistics such as chimpanzees being 99% the same genetically. This would suggest that chimpanzees are the absolute best animal
coincides with personal view on the value of chimpanzees as alternative test subject
i think there is a difference between animals and humans - including how we are made up .You can't expect a drug that works on a animal, to work on a human also.
It wasn't that great of an argument because it simply stated that animals are similar to humans and share 99% of their DNA (even though humans share more than like 90% of their DNA with a banana and you don't see any testing done on bananas); it didn't pr
Reiterates and is based on the idea that human lives are more valuable than animal ones, which is accepted by most people.
From a medical standpoint, all of these arguments make sense. Personally, it is difficult to not consider an animal's suffering, emotions, etc. when thinking about lab testing. As an animal lover and pet owner, but also a future medical student, it is dif
nothing
Animal testing for medical reasons has many steps in order for it to be authorized. There are things in place to keep the animal as comfortable as possible.
I think it's great that animals benefit from animal testing. I thought the argument was convincing, it might even change my stand on animal testing. However, I still feel bad for the animals who do get tested. Although testing one can greatly affect the l

Both arguments are very much valid and they both use scientific and knowledgeable sources as their evidence.

It mentioned an actual organization. 
Provides plenty of evidence to support the claim that animal testing is highly regulated, which makes it pretty convincing. 
Facts and transitions 
Made very interesting points in which were backed up and supported. Gave an interesting point of view. 
In our culture, choice is a very integral part of everyday life. While it is an extremely serious and sensitive issue, if someone is terminally ill and is going to die regardless, they should be able to communicate that they want to die to their family an
The previous argument made a solid point by pointing out that assisted suicide is ultimately the choice of the person because they are ultimately the ones who are suffering. 
I rated this argument as strong because it tied into other rights that we have as Americans. 
Sounded similar to another argument as before. I think the last bit was the most convincing part of the argument.
The argument wasn't very coherent. It was all over the place, and made anaolgies that did not completely relate. 
I definitely agree with this argument. The right to life applies more to murder than to assisted suicide, for the victim of the murder did not choose to relinquish their right to live. The person who wants to commit suicide has made the decision to relinq

My comment is the same as the last three articles. People have the right to take their own lives. I dont see a problem with it at all. Of course legalities will be addressed. Life insurance will be void. P{
Smoothness
It wasn't a very strong argument because it wasn't supported by any facts and it was more formatted like an opinion. Like saying that it would be better for the family member to have more information but there is nothing to show that that might change thi
An argument for more effective communication before something as serious as assisted suicide makes for a compelling argument.
The argument was strong because it stated how the families of the person who wants to die would be affected and how bringing this issue into the forefront would help. 
The last sentence make sense but I still cannot agree to assisted suicide. I still think that we should try to solve any problems or issues faced by these people
From the previous argument, I can see why assisted suicide should be brought into the open. However, I don't believe the argument was that strong in the example that was provided. It is too general and does not actually allow me to personally relate to it
Argument too emotional 
I believed the second argument to be stronger, since it brings the patient's family and his own self into the equation. After all, it is about the patient, and not just the doctor. I agree that it can help alleviate the patient's suffering, whether it be 
This argument makes a lot of sense. If assisted suicide were legalized, people would not be afraid to discuss their decision with their family because they would not have to fear the repercussions that would afflict the person assisting their suicide. 
Families should have the option to discuss this, because isn't watching a family member suffer through life, and literally get nothing out of it, be worse than letting them make the decision to die
States their opinion and views that are personal. There a distinct cases that are different from each other and they only mention one side of the story and only specific cases that may be true.
This argument seems viable aside from the fact that it says that doctors are doing it anyway so it might as well be allowed. But simply because it is being practiced doesn't mean that it should be legalized or mainstreamed. They need to provide other evid
assisted suicide should be regulated, and I do feel it is wrong to help someone die. However under certain circumstances perhaps it can be justifiable.
Keeping someone alive while they are in pain is equivalent to doing harm to a life.  It may be against morals and there are many fine lines to thise situation.
The argument used a lot of emotionally-charged words, however, it also employed logical reasoning. The call to action at the end of the text seemed a impressive argumentative tactic, and left me feeling a little more convinced. 
Doctors are legally supposed to do what they can to keep the patient alive. 
The argument was able to provide support from a doctor's point of view and shows that there are ways to perform assisted suicide where it is justifiable 
I was confused with what they were trying to argue. Did they support it or not?
I felt the quote did nothing for the argument but hinder it and add nonsense. 
This argument confused me since it wasn't clear what side it was taking. 
I thought the comparisons to other forms of ethical killing were convincing. The last bit about doctors knowing the difference though didn't convince me. I would take that part out of the argument to make it stronger.
This argument addressed a majority of concerns about assisted suicide. Also, the text provided a counterargument to those who oppose assisted suicide.
It was coherent and made sense. It is legal and it is assumed there is consent. However, how can you be sure of this consent?
people should have the option to decide that for themselves. If they view themselves as a burden to their family or caregivers its okay for them to make that decision if their in a good state of mind
I don't know why the author included the first sentence about religion; it was totally irrelevant and, in fact, it kind of weakened the author's credibility. The issue was not properly presented; I got confused while reading because the paper was not orga
I believed this was a strong article because it persuaded me to rethink the position I already had about assisted suicide. It brought up other situations in which people allow people to die and how doctors can tell the difference between killing someone w
This is a strong statement, because it shows that assisted suicide isn't looked down upon in every culture, but our doctors know the moral difference between rightful killing and helping.
They were well argued and I agreed with their opinions
This argument was very in the middle because this is a topic that is talked about with very little evidence since most opinions can't be supported very strongly. Therefore it wasn't a weak argument but it wasn't a strong one either. 
Patients should be exposed to all the possible solutions that they can get
For this one, I didn't really think it that much through. However, I just feel like this argument is fairly strong, but not that strong
This text provide counterarguments for critics of assisted suicide and assurance that this decision in not made due to laziness of doctors to find alternative treatments.
Interesting view. 
This argument says that the doctors should first go through every method, and persuasion possible to get the patients not to commit suicide before actually doing so, which is a great idea. It allows the patient to truly have every option laid out in front
Giving the option to decide is the most important thing.
The paper does make a good point about the situation, but it could be improved if it included evidence to support the claim
This article demonstrates a valid point about how palliative care can still be dying with dignity.

This argument takes into the fact that doctors do not want to do assisted death, and really urge patients to try other options before reaching that decision. It shows that the doctors don't want their patients to die, it is ultimately up to the patients w
Thought if it was me in the example.
The premise was based on one story which is a logical fallacy. Just because one family feels like there is closure from the death penalty does not mean that most families feel that way. 
I did not think this argument was that strong because he talked about how some people feel closure while other's don't. In order for an argument to be strong, it should be more convincing. Yet, he is saying that some people don't agree with his point.
the argument related the death penalty to someone who lost their mother to a killer. this causes some unease. It shows how someone did not receive closer and were still afraid of the possibility of release. However, this release was never guaranteed and i
Relies upon subjective impression from victim's kinfolk, who are understandably biased in the matter.
I just do not find arguments that rely on human emotion in this manner strong. 
I feel like they made a very large claim but did not provide any evidence to support the claim. 
Although there are some good evidence for the support of this argurment, there are also some statements which are not supported and merely the author's opinion. For example, the execution may not prevent murderers, since may criminals do not expect to be 
This statement seemed strong to me because the author discussed their opinion about the death penalty and then used facts to back it up.
The argument is weak because it is based off the assumption that there are no murderers who simply kill to kill. Also, it does not take into account for murderers who are willing to die and risk their life. Furthermore, murderers with mental illnesses may
Claims that capital punishment deter crime supported with study results. 
This just sounds like something made up, it's a way to make the death penalty seem okay
The fact that it actually cited a particular study and provided statistics. This is obviously still a questionable statement and questionable "facts" but having hard evidence is better than the "sources" that are cited by the previous argument. The argume
I felt like this one was basically just repeating "An eye for an eye" but not explaining anything more.  
I was thinking that there are other crimes that dont have a corresponding punisment like rape or arson. so the eye for an eye argument was not very strong to me.
I think murder should be considered for death penalty
Even at a young age, children know that is wrong to commit first degree murder.  Crimes like these are against unjustifiable aside from a few exceptions.
I kind of agree that life is sacred and valued and depending on the case or crime, a life is worth a life. 
interesting points
Although this argument does include the support of a secondary source in support of their argument they do not include strong evidence in support of their claim. Also, the secondary source that they included did not directly support their claim, and was n
The argument provided no empirical evidence to support their argument, merely pulling a quote from TIME magazine about death (not even in full reference to the death penalty)
Its harsh to say some things about abortion. Its not a human being till its born. 
If human life is valued, why is taking a murderer's life not the case? Are they any less valued? Yes they committed a bad crime but killing them resolves nothing. Need more statements and facts to back up opinion. 
This was great! I liked the logic behind it.  I found myself thinking, "that's true"
That is a logical argument, but then an issue arises. What counts as a heinous crime to the point where one's own life is forfeited? Would stealing a loaf of bread constitute a death penalty? Social and Cultural norms can play a huge influence in these de
I actually don't believe criminals have as much right as this argument says it has. Movement and Speech? Even though they are a citizen of the United States of America, they have broken the law; therefore, they have broken their rights.
I agree. Certain crimes do classify for execution
There can be more to the crime than stated.  Execution after a heinous crime without all facts is wrong to me. 
good emphasis on how it is not devaluing life
The arguments do not include evidence they are rather mere opinions with no sound support of the claims they make. They also do not address the opposition and are based on unsupported assumptions.
It all depends on who's reading the argument. Someone that believes life is truly sacred and murdering is wrong in all circumstances will probably not seem as phased by an argument like this. The argument itself seems strong, but kind of vague.
No one forgoes their right to life ever; when someone dies, it doesn't mean they ask for it. Humans aren't born good or bad but are a product of their environment. I'm not saying its right to kill and to let murderers loose, but taking a life for taking a

As I read this I thought about my experience watching the television of certain court cases on the news (Jodi Arias case in particular). That case only lasted a year or two but they had solid evidence that she had committed the crime. based of this I was 
I felt like this statement didn't have a clear stance on the death penalty and was just voicing their opinion.
The argument was strong because it had the potential to show empirical evidence, even though it was based on morality.
To be honest this was worded a bit weird for me at least. I believe that the death penalty is actually something good. A person deserves to die if he or she stole someone's life. I have seen too much to think that they should still be alive. 
There was too many words for it to make sense to me

That the punishment is actually meant for the right person. I know how problematic wrongful convictions and confessions can be, and how prevalent they can be, so this assurance is a strong point for me.

I agree with the argument .
The argument was logical, but some of the evidence given to support the conclusion was not as strong as it could be. For example, one of the supporting pieces of evidence was not fully supported by facts.
I believe he justified himself well when he said it was equally bad to have someone spend his life in jail for a crime he did not commit. It was good that he presented an argument to a potential counter.
the second argument was confusing because it talked about biases of the jury and then biases of racial discrimination. it was hard to understand and made the argument weak
Does not address question of capital punishment but rather justice system as a whole.
The argument brought in human bias, which I feel is a strong point in any argument.
The words were strong, but they were not convincing.  In fact, they were down right antagonizing as it put abortions and people who do it in such a negative light.
The wording was not very professional and seems more based on opinion than fact
Not bearing the child may be for reasons that may be better for the unborn child because he/she may not be given the support necessary. I feel like that law is more geared towards attacking pregnant mothers.
I felt that the argument was slightly weak. It had strong key points; however, I thought some of the information was outdated. 
The writer established evidence of many states whom also agree with their opinion. He/she claimed abortion is murder, but also only used 1-2 sources to back up this claim. 
I thought that this was somewhat of a weak argument because it relied on one person's opinion and did not provide the enough evidence to create a stronger argument.  /

The only argument was that life begins at conception, but the evidence supporting it was weak. Quoting a single scientist who discovered the cause for Down syndrome does not make him a credible source to support the idea that life begins at conception.
Both of the arguments were strong because it portrayed evidences as to why a particular side was right. 
The first argument had some numbers to back it up but not by much. The second argument appeals to those who believe that life begins at conception and not at birth. Since whether life begins either at conception or birth is debatable, it doesn't serve as 
When I rated the strength of this argument, I was thinking how this sounds like only one person's opinion and was not really backed up by evidence that would make the argument stringer. 
I was thinking about my own opinions on abortion.

Argument that all people should be treated equally
This was an alright argument, slightly stronger than the last 2, but still not all that strong.  Abortion statistics seem off, as well as the farming of the argument.  It just wasn't all convincing.
Freakonomics threw me off
The information presented was not as strong because not everyone may think contraception is a bad thing. 
It demonstrates its argument in a fashion that allowed the reader to understand the issue with abortion. 
I was thinking about the variety of sources used, but also the extent to which one could make a claim that just because birth levels declined, it was due to abortion. There could be other factors that could contribute to this decline. 
What I was thinking when choosing the strength of the argument included how the statistics were representative of their arguments and how that could affect an individual in a harmful way because abortion should not be seen as a form of contraceptive, but 
Some women would take advantage and abuse the right to have abortions.
If it's not your body, it's not your choice.

I think this person makes a valid point, but I also feel that there could be many counter arguments that make this argument look a little weak.

I thought that this argument was also strong, but it may have been because of the diction used. I didn't really see to much evidence being shown in this argument. 
It had many different examples of ways that the use of animals could be avoided. It didn't really say how effective this research has been though, but with all research, the effect/outcome isn't absolutely clear until used on actual humans. 
Neither reference gives any possible alternatives.  Also, if animal models are as ineffective as they claim they are, why are there many drugs and treatments that are effective?
Even though I agreed with the statement, I rated it weaker because I was thinking about the actual past accomplishments previously mentioned in some of the arguments.
Makes sense... it is true that animals do not perfectly equate to humans, so testing will not always be perfect.
The argument in the last page made sense, provided ample information and statistics, including the source from which the statistics came from
Again, much like the last argument, it is interesting and makes sense to me. 
i think I support animal testing now... if it would protect the animal and save lives. 
Clearly, animals are not humans, but often times they die from similar diseases and poisons that will create a model to better improve a human one.
It was hard to say because they had a credible resource (the professor from Johns Hopkins) that stated why animal testing should not be legal
The last argument had no credibility to it. It provided few evidence and little explanation, making it a weak argument. It did not convince me at all by stating the obvious "animals are different from human beings."
The last was strong because it highlighted the negative effects of animal testing
I have heard personal stories where drugs in the public are recalled.
This seems reasonable.  However, many more treatments that were tested on animals have proven effective when applied to humans as well, not to mention how valuable animals have been in gaining knowledge about human psychology and physiology

I thought this was a strong argument because it provided examples of medication, some well known, that benefit humanity even though there was no animal testing.

It was an interesting argument, although I feel like it doesn't get to the point of what most of the problems people have with animal testing are. I feel like most of the problems are considered in the inhumane nature of testing, but this also presented a
Seemed entirely possible but wasn't convinced due to what seems to be poor sources/statistics
I'm pretty much indifference about animal testing. never really thought about it.
They provided relevant, prominent examples as to why animal testing is an unreliable comparison to human vaccinations. 
Bad studies don't justify animal use, true, but it's not that strong because not all studied can be blinded or randomized.
I am not sure that the supporting quotes were used in the proper context. It is then hard for me to establish credibility. 
What animals go through verses how much it's worth  / 
Thoughts were on the animal lives wasted on flawed research
nothing / 
the evidence provided for this argument seemed stronger than the opposing argument.
Death is a choice, however bringing issues out in the open can be helpful
i think it is up to the individual if he/ she wants to die. / 
The argument was weak because it relied on morals as its main focus.  
We cannot outlaw abortion based on the notion that someone might change their mind later. The women who get abortions do not do so lightly and have put a lot of thought into their decisions. By outlawing abortion in case they change their mind, undermines
Patients should be able to make decisions about ending their lives if they have no psychological problems, this can be checked. 
People have the right to end their life if they want. The only thing that would make me consider otherwise is mental health of the person resquesting it. If a person is in pain, they have the right to request help in assisting them to leave. I would rathe
The first argument was awful. I need evidence that because euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands that is why they do not have a lot of palliative care. The second argument was better and made you feel something. Feel empathy. 
Seems more opinionated rather than fact based. There doesnt seem to be a main claim in the  argument. 
This argument seemed weak to me because it suggested counseling instead of tackling the issue head-on. 
They didn't give any good reasons for why it is important to preserve human life at all costs. They just assumed that it was.
This argument takes into account the patients' needs and the duty of the doctor in connection with assisted suicide. The test gives various reason for why assisted suicide is necessary and possibly a better alternative to further treatment.
It addressed the consequences with therpay for the family, but it did not talk about the person who is actually dying.
If the care is there an they dont want it than they dont want it.
The paper was providing information but it would've helped if evidence was provided to make the argument strong. 
By providing an example and facts about alternatives to assisted suicide, the article was strong enough. If more alternatives were provided, the article could have been immensely strong, but it was good enough. 
This argument shows that terminally ill patients are not in much pain toward the end. However, it does not take into the account that these medications practically put them in a very sleepy state because that's how much it takes for them to not feel pain 
This argument seems strong to me due to personal experience. My grandpa was in the hospital because he had a heart condition and he decided that he didn't want to live like that anymore so he went into hospice, refused to eat, drink, take his medicine, et
I feel like suicide should always be avoided. Family should be part of the decsion. 
The argument was speculating what may happen or may be felt but there are many factors that contribute to euthanization that even as a burden, it may be the best possible decision, even in a selfless way.
Both arguments focused on only one possibility of the family's reaction. The hypothetical situations were either all bad or all good, when in reality, it might be an awkward blend of both that cannot be easily explained by means of logical thinking and ar
Too emotional, only considers the feelings of the family/friends 
The argument added an emotional aspect where the reader feels bad for someone who might have to partake in assisted suicide
Even though it is on the other side of what I believe, it was well argued and made me think of ideas I had not thought of before. 
It was somewhat strong because it posed an interesting argument that wasn't completely supported but made logical sense and flowed through with the ending being sort of evidence. 
The argument is not very strong since it didn't give a scenario or a more specific example. However, it does provide the doctors' moral thinking.
While I was reading and rating the argument, I feel like the person has extremely strong feelings towards anti-suicide. I do agree that doctors having the ability to decide when people should be saved and when they should die is morally wrong. The argumen
Most of the text ignored the decision and well-being of the patient and limited their argument to the doctor's point of view. Furthermore, the text implied that doctors can make the decision to end a patient's life without their consent.  
Great writing skills.
I do agree that it would give doctors an additional immense burden to bear, but at the same time in no way was this argument taking the patient into account. Assisted suicide is mainly about the patient, not just about the doctor, and to think that it is 
interesting
This paper is fairly strong because it provides various reasons to explain the claim. Including the quote at the end seemed to work well but other may seem that it is outdated. 
I believed that the article was only slightly stronger because it provided evidence of why medical professionals oppose legalizing assisted suicide. By providing the line of oath and explaining the burden it could have on medical professionals, the articl
What is the point of living if you cannot enjoy life itself. Dementia patients often have little to no memories of family, some even go into a vegetative state. What is the point to living if you have to stay in bed all day, cannot communicate, cannot eat
This argument is strong because it looks at ht exact that if assisted suicide was legalized, then many people would be more suspicious of doctors and maybe even blame them for other deaths which could get really messy. This statement looked at the effects
the argument was strong because it used ethos to support its stance.
I do believe it is wrong. 
i think it is up to the individual if he/she wants to die and isn't considered an unlawful killing
The arguement was strong because there was a reason for their argument rather than relying on morals.  
That's true and that is a consideration that making death and assisted suicide more readily available might lead to corruption and cause unwarranted deaths as either cover up or by expanding it to allow family members to end the life of someone in a coma,
Both sides should be able to make a decisin together
There will always be individual problem with these issues. No matter what, I believe people have the right to do what they want with their own body as long as they are mentally competent. People change their minds all the time 
This argument seemed weaker in my opinion because it only listed one country as a place with bad pallative care and euthenasia is allowed. This argument seemed to suggest that an effect of assisted suicide is bad hospice care while they may be completely 
I dont agree with that argument personally, but the argument was constructed well with evidence that swayed me a little. 
suicide cannot always be prevented but suicide should never be assissted 
I enjoyed the overall impression that the article was being neutral and relatively unbiased by strictly stating statistics and personal stories, rather than including emotionally-charged words. 
The argument seemed too exaggerated to me. It seems pretty unlikely that doctors would prefer to euthanize their patients rather than treating them
I started out thinking the argument was going one way and then it changed.  
I was thinking about the famous Standford prison study regarding jail time. The argument is clear though.
I agree that the death penalty may be immorally wrong, but I believe more that the death penalty does bring closure to the victim's family as stated in the argument.
I guess this can be considered. It might be better to suffer than to just execute the person. But it really depends on the crime that was committed
I agree with the statements of stanford of the thoughts of the parties involved
used appeal to psychiatrist 
The argument includes a study that was conducted by an accredited source and focuses on the consequences that do not necessarily achieve what one may have thought. However, it does not propose an extensive explanation of whether or not death penalty shoul
Psychiatrist from Stanford made this argument. There's the authority bias (because he's an "expert"). If someone likes Stanford, there may be a liking bias involved as well. There are probably more biases involved that I cannot think of and when there is 
Backs up point with professional's advice that some families do not get solace in seeing the murderer of their loved one die. 
these focused on the emotional consequences associated with taking someones life which is an extremely traumatic incident
explains that criminals may use the death penalty to escape the punishment for their crimes 
The argument was well worded and it made a strong rebuttal of the previous argument. 
the argument was a fair and logical rebutal of the detering effect of the death penalty. Lots of resheach and crime rate data provided making it a good argument against death penalty. 
The death penalty is an option in a financial aspect as it is less expensive than housing a criminal in jail for life. The previous arguments did reveal that it is difficult to view justice without bias, so the arguments showed that it was against the dea
Demographic and social factors play a large role when determining of the deterrent factors of the death penalty.   These factors are important and should not be dismissed as unimportant.
I think the end of this argument was strong and interesting but at the same time it did not give any qualitative data or credible sources to back up their facts. 
I thought about what sort of evidence was used to back up the argument (such as statistics, expert opinion, etc) and rated according to how much was incorporated in the argument presented. 
Im not completely sure where I stand as far as Death oenalty is concerned. I could argue each way. 
As I read the last argument, I felt that I really agreed with that mentality that was expressed in the argument. 
First off, the entire argument is based on one premise that not everyone may agree on which makes this argument somewhat weak. If someone does not believe in that one premise, then the rest of the argument is irrelevent. The rest of the argument is okay, 
I am not very aware of death penalty laws, but this statement seemed strong to me and gave me information I would like to know if I were trying to read up and gain more information about the death penalty.
The argument makes sense and may compel someone to think of it as a strong argument. However, the argument will ultimately need statistical proof concerning socioeconomic effects on the American population because the argument is mostly based off of the m
Relies upon subjective definition of "fairness."
Shows a huge contradiction
I guess I was thinking about the philosophical implication of taking a life, and whether the death penalty was just a primitive way of reacting. Giving into our baser desires to take a life because they overstepped some boundary. 
This argument got right to the point.  Here is the fact, here is why and here is a conclusion.  I liked that it wasn't clouded with big names and statistics.  
The argument was not as stong as other against the death penalty. Its only point was that it was not humane and not much reasoning behind it. 
I disagree slightly because executing someone who has done several things to be considered for the death penalty is something to be considered. especially when it comes to murderers 
In some cases that involve murder, he or she that committed the crime devalued the life of their victim.  I would not say that the death penalty necessarily devalues life.
I was thinking there are certain degrees of crimes where death penalties may be the only option and it does not mean the government is exercising murder so to say.  
used good appeal to rights
The arguments didn't include a counterargument that addressed the other side. Also, they didn't recognize the large amount of those who were rightfully convicted of their felony and are facing the death penalty. They didn't recognize the economic gains of
The argument referenced the Constitution, which I thought was a good source to use to back the argument. Also, I believe that many people would agree that death is one of the cruelest punishments, which follows along the same thought process.
Still not sure. It seems unfair to kill the people in such a way. 
Declare more facts and less opinions - any one can easily feel that way but by backing it up with findings and articles, you make your argument better because you can address potential counterarguments. 
It appealed to my emotions.
The fact that people who faced the death penalty have been freed is a very strong argument because it shows that people can make mistakes, yet the death penalty is final. 
In the argument, it showed both the positive and negative sides of the death penalty. it showed how the death of the convicted should be taken away when they have taken away the life of an innocent. but it also showed how wrongful convictions could lead t
People should just die if they kill someone. Blunt but honest. 
Like before, our justice system is not perfect
The argument brought up an interesting fact about how many executed people ended up innocent. 
i would not like it if i was wrongfully accused and found guilty and charged with the death penalty. kind of like in "Gone Girl"
The first two thoughts were similar in strength because it mentioned motives or lack of motive to create a crime. The last one was strongest because it shows statistics in the different prejudices people have in judging the intensity of a crime.
The description of the inequalities in the justice system stood out as a strong argument for why the death penalty should not be legal.
Why are there so many passages? Quite honestly, I'm getting a little tired from staring at my screen for this long. However, the argument does make a valid point. Racial and gender identities can provide juries with bias, so we shouldn't give the death pe
I don't really have any further opinion or thought. This was straightforward
These arguments present a strong stance that the death penalty has the capability to induce fear into people, eventually resulting in a decrease in crime rate. Some may argue that this logic is far fetched, but the death penalty provides a punishment more
Although this argument made good points it did not say where they got their information and why the death penalty should or shouldn't be continued.  The facts were interesting but did not sway me either way.
Very long argument.... Detailed and pretty specific... very strong
this takes a stance that i have not heard of before and explains that this issue can corrupt the justice system which defeats the purpose of the death penalty in the first place
